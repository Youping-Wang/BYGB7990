# Bulls and Cows
### Introduction
- This is a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. 

### Rules of the Game 
- It's a pencil and paper game played by two players. The two players write a 4-digit number on a sheet of paper. The digits must be all different, but there is a version, where digits can be used more than once. Each player has to find out the opponent's secret code. To this purpose, the players - in turn - try to guess the opponent's number. The opponent has to score the guess
- A "bull" is a digit which is located at the right position. If, for example, the hidden code is "4 3 2 5" and the guess is "4 3 1 2", then we have the two bulls "4" and "3" in the guess "4 3 1 2". 
- A "Cow" on the other hand is a correct number, which is on the wrong position. The "2" of the previous example is a cow.
